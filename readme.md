## Introduction & Declaration
This repository is a record of my previous work done for Computer Networking course. It's not a music player for daily use.       

Skills & Knowledges I learned through this programming experience:
* TCP sockets programming in Python
* mutli-threading
    * how to create threads in Python
    * how to make container thread-safe
* understanding of protocol
* some other knowledges about computer networking

## Main Function
What can users do in the client-end:
